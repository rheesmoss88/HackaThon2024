# Roadmap 
"Your project idea sounds promising and directly addresses Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) - Affordable and Clean Energy. 
Suggested outline for your project:"


### "Frontend" Development: 
1.  Develop a user-friendly interface where users can input their data. (can be pretty simple for now add sick shit later)
2.  Utilize HTML and JavaScript(button) for frontend(and "backend" calculations) development.
### "Backend" Development: 
1.  Implement the backend logic using JavaScript.  
2.  Calculate financial metrics such as payback period, monthly savings, and potential profit based on user inputs.

# Extra Shit
Data Analysis: 
1. Analyze historical solar energy production data for Kelowna, British Columbia. * Use this data to provide predictions for the following year's profit, debt, costs, etc.
2.  Implement algorithms to forecast future solar energy production based on historical data and relevant factors (e.g., weather patterns, technological advancements). 
3.  User Input and Output: 
4.  Allow users to input their energy usage, electricity costs, and desired solar panel size. 
5. Display the calculated financial information such as payback period, monthly savings, and potential profit. 
6.  Provide visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs) to help users understand the financial implications of investing in solar panels.
7. Localization: * Ensure that the application is specific to Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada. * Incorporate relevant local data and factors that may affect solar energy production and financial calculations in the region. 
8. Testing and Deployment: * Test the application thoroughly to ensure accuracy and reliability of calculations. 
9.  Deploy the application to a web server to make it accessible to users. * Consider using platforms like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean for deployment
